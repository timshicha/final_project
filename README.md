Project description:
The code is two different models - NN (Neural Network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine). We wanted to find how the difference in training set sizes affects different models' accuracies. Our hypothesis is that withholding training examples would have a more drastic effect on the NN than on the SVM since NNs are data-hungry. The training data sizes of 10% of data, 25% of data and 100% of data are used to train the models.

Data used:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

The data is a record of about 500 women who were tested for breast cancer. There are 30 input attributes for each case, and each case has a label: benign (it is not cancer) or malignan (it is cancer). Most of the inputs are datails about the patients' tumors.
